# **Fleet_Routing_and_Assignment**

## AIM: Determine which aircraft to fly on each route, and the sequence of segments flown by each aircraft.

The fleet planning decision-making process is one of the most problematic
issues for airline industry. An over-large fleet size would cause an airline
unnecessary expense since the increasing capital assets account for a large
proportion of the airline operational costs. Moreover, considering the profit
margin of the airline industry around the world continuously pressured by a
long-term exposure to a high-cost and low-fare environment, the irrational fleet
composition would necessarily deteriorate the airlineâ€™s operation. Therefore,
airlines may have to develop a more practical fleet planning approach to meet
passenger demand with lower costs and more controllable risks at a strategic
level.

Here in this project I considered 3 planes moving between 6 airports so that
maximum number of passengers can be flown between these airports.
The main contribution by this project is as follows:

* Cost minimization of the company by considering the total distance
traveled by all the planes and the number of airports used by them.

* The segment flown by each aircraft.

In the next section, the problem is presented in detail. The formulation of the
problem is solved on MATLAB software of which all necessary files are shared in
the master branch.


### PROBLEM

  Airline fleet planning process is one of the most problematic issues for airline
  industry. Considering the profit margin of the airline industry and the high
  competition in the industry around the world, if the aircraft planning is not
  optimized properly it can be very detrimental to the company. Therefore,
  airlines must develop a more practical fleet planning approach to meet market
  demand with lower costs and more controllable risks at a strategic level. From
  the plethora of problems faced by the airline companies, some are:
 
* **Network Design problem** which consists in mainly deciding which
    airports should be served by the airline.
    
* **Fleet Design problem** which consists in deciding the size and the
    composition of the fleet of the airline.
    
* **Flight Scheduling problem** which consists in finding when and how
    often should each leg flight be operated in a planning period.
    
* **Fleet Assignment problem** which consists in assigning a well-suited
    aircraft type to each flight leg.
    
* **Aircraft Routing problem** which consists in designing the sequence of
    flight legs that each aircraft will have to operate on.
    
* **Crew Management problem** which consists in designing a work
    schedule for each crew member to be able to operate each flight leg.
    
* **Cost Design problem** which consists of deciding the minimum cost
    that the company must bear for total distance covered by an aircraft.
    
    
    This project will analyze and optimize the problem using LPP model and with the
    help of MATLAB software.
